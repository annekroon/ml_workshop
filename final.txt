__label__0.5	 I find it difficult to believe that you often act out an actual living, breathing Hollywood Blockbuster spy thriller super villain, but here we are...
__label__1.0	 I guess Chuck that's why you better move your ass for a change and for once get tax reform done.So shut up and do your damn job such a ass!
__label__0.5	 I guess it is the prospective. Destabilizing medical insurance, threats to cut Medicare and Medicaid are devastation-for many like me. But hey I will try to smile with the knife in my back, if it makes you happier.
__label__1.0	 I guess math wasn't your best subject. Poor pay $0 in taxes so what can you cut?<USER> please get her an abacus
__label__0.0	 I guess you still don't realize that A Better Deal is yet another failed attempt to verbalize what your party stands for.
__label__1.0	 I had a long conversation with a non-Trump supporter today. She thought it was a great move on trumps part. It was lack of understanding and ignorance on her part to not know the full implications
__label__1.0	 I have a question mr ratcliffe, where is just one democratic attorney or politician that is honorable enough to admit that, just one!!
__label__1.0	 I have lost faith in all democrats!

__label__1.0	 I just don<U+FFFD>t get why you did it. Not the legacy you want.
__label__1.0	 I just love the lack of a simple<USER> from your statement. Illegal. If its was you would state so.
__label__1.0	 I just signed up! These email updates must be where you're going to address white supremacy in the White House &amp; IN-09, right? Oh wait... <URL>
__label__1.0	" I knew they weren't proud when Wednesday morning the passage of ""tax reform"" was NOT headline news on any feed. SHAME."
__label__0.0	 I love this woman. I can<U+FFFD>t believe there<U+FFFD>s one person in her district that would vote against her. Don<U+FFFD>t make that mistake CA. Vote this experienced and brave woman back into office. Thanks.
__label__0.5	 I mean, unless you were taking it literally, which is horrifying.
__label__1.0	 I mean, who wants their gas bill lowered? Besides, any savings would inevitably be robbed by Albany and DC.
__label__1.0	 I meant Trump Dossier. It's fake and Richard Steel was paid to make this up and use it to prove Trump needs daily security briefings.
__label__1.0	 I miss having common sense and clear thoughts in the White House. Adam Schiff, you should consider running for president. Your watching of the president helps me sleep at night.
__label__1.0	 I now know who I won't support
__label__1.0	 I really can<U+FFFD>t remember your complaints when Hillary<U+FFFD>s team smashed phones, that was real. Sick of all this covering up and partisan #crap. Call a spade a #spade and give justice for all!!
__label__1.0	 I really hope <USER> has something up his sleeve, but I doubt it. Democrats can't seem to get their heads around the idea that the <USER> has no honor. <USER>'s word means nothing, it's been proven over &amp; over again, especially when it comes to anyone who isn't white.
__label__1.0	 I refuse to be lectured by a liar.
__label__0.0	 I saw the one about AdamSchiff trying to buy picture of POTUS naked but I knew that couldn<U+FFFD>t be real...is it?
__label__0.5	 I say #GoForIt   I<U+FFFD>ll enjoy watching the #Backlash!
__label__1.0	 I support you but we need to wrap up the Russia investigation &amp; remove trump.

__label__1.0	 I think the time has come for <USER> to step down.  Oh, and yes, Franken, too.
__label__0.0	 I think your decision making process is correct. Drive down specific costs for Mainers where you know you can get the best results to the dollar. Brave call amidst the clamor and relative hysteria. I think you are doing the right things.
__label__1.0	" I thought snow flakes where the ""sensitive ones""..."
__label__1.0	 I thought Trump was a protector of monuments. He protested when they took the Robert E. Lee monument down and thought it was a crime.
__label__0.0	 I totally agree!!
__label__1.0	 I understand the $ rationale for Alaska in allowing more drilling in Denali. But where are your sensibilities about the environment, wildlife habitat, endangered species, and pristine wilderness? Just found a way to offset corporate tax cuts, heh?
__label__0.0	 I want to know how you have the audacity to pass this #taxscam and NOT demand that the American people the right to see <USER> taxes? <URL>
__label__1.0	 I will never forget that McCain was pardoned for TREASON by Nixon. He is no HERO!  #Nam

__label__0.5	 I will never vote Republican again. I voted for <USER> and <USER> but never again. <USER> have sold this country out. #traitors
__label__0.0	 I wish all American had good insurance like you
__label__1.0	 I wish I had 2 senators with 1/2 a brain, but I don<U+FFFD>t they would vote yes even if <USER> submitted a bill that would call for his beheading <USER> would vote yes. I believe he doesn<U+FFFD>t have a NO button at his desk. <URL>
__label__0.5	 I wish senate and congress could fix the VA and Medicare like the Pats fix the refs.
__label__0.0	 I wish the Dems were this loyal to each other!

__label__1.0	 I would have my memory checked you lying pig
__label__0.0	 I would like for him to tell us when he plans to step down!
__label__0.5	 I would like to give you the point of view of a 58 year old white man who was devastated by the murder of Doctor King. I think you will find it enlightening. I can also tell you why don't use african-American and flat hate that babydaddy BS
__label__1.0	 I would love to see you and Pelosi and Warren out of office your all dead wood collecting paychecks from my tax money \n<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0>
__label__1.0	 I<U+FFFD>d like strict gun control so that we never have to mourn the loss of 18 innocent lives on another Valentine<U+FFFD>s Day again. Stop sugarcoating everything, you dip wad
__label__0.5	 I<U+FFFD>d love to, but cannot afford a contribution at this time. So...my name doesn<U+FFFD>t go on.
__label__0.0	 I<U+FFFD>m not a fan of your politics, but I hope you feel better. Nobody deserves that. The asshole who attacked you should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

__label__1.0	 If Chelsea Clinton took a meeting with Russians what would you say?  If her national security adviser was indicted what would you say?
__label__1.0	 If Congress doesn't step up NOW and deal with the crisis in PR/USVI we are holding you responsible as well as the orange idiot
